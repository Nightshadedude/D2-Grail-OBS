# D2-Grail-OBS Project

## Goal:
This will be a Grail helper that will grab item data from the game, add it to a running list stored within a Google Sheet, and allow for the data to be hooked into OBS via browser source or webhook (I haven't decided which, maybe both)

### TODOs:
-Data scraper to pull data out of the game.  There are present solutions for pulling data out of a save file, but none specifically for all game data (specifically drops)

-HTTP server to send/recieve data out of Google Sheets
  -Setup instructions for enabling API access in Google Sheets

-Either HTML templates or webhooks to integrate into OBS

### Changelog
